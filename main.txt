Far away in the future......In a darken and strange room is a robot with some part malfunctioning.He doesn't know 
how he is in that room but he tries all the possible methods and technique to escape the room.

So our movie will be based in a room with a robot trying to get free from the room.

Story Plot:
The movie starts with a bang and a big noise of a explosion but the camera is set to the robot in a strange room.
Every minute or so we hear sounds of explosion and the room shaking but we don't know whats actually is going on outside.
In the mean time the robot is functional but is damaged too much.(The year is 3012 and nanotech is fully evolved 
the robot was the first highy intelligent nanobot and that is only the information the viewers will know).The robot
start its repair sequence and all of the sudden all its parts start to get repaired consuming the object of the room.
(The robot is capable of converting object into a raw material for its parts).After recovery is complete robot attempts
to get out of the room.At first it tries its navigator but somehow its not working.(Need to work on the details of
robot attempts to escape).Finally the robot is out of the room and he finds out that the room was very deep 
under the earth crust and quickly reaches to the groun and discovers that the earth is ruined and the explosion noise
was of astroid hitting the earth.Suddenly he recives the message(need a logic on how) that to escape the earth using a
space capsule just opposite the room where he was locked.He uses his full speed to reach the room but a spark from the
astroid flame destroyes the robot.
At last scene after the destruction(As we know that robot is nanotech and capable of fixing itself) we focus camera on
a small remaining piece of robot and the consumption of the material around it.

End of the movie.
After the story is approved we need to work on the details.
